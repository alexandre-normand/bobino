My kids started getting into coding and I thought I'd try to introduce them to `Go` for my own pleasure (since I enjoy `Go` more than any
other language, it's easier to work through difficult teaching times). 

This package is a collection of utilities to help making small text-based interactive apps easier. It purposefully tries to shield the user
from dealing with errors too much (it's a good concept to think about early on but the primary focus is on making it possible to build something
quickly and develop an interest for creating)
